An abstract package is harder to take an effect of change,
thus becomes more stable. We assume that measure of
PPDA determines consistency of change that takes place in a
package while interacting with other packages. On the contrary
unstable package is assumed to be irresponsible (restricted
to internal dependencies) and easy to be changed
which is determined by CPDA. To define the link between
instability and abstractness of package, Martin introduced
graph based approach with package internal stability measure
on horizontal axis and abstractness on vertical axis as
shown in Figure 1.
Therefore, a package at location (0,1) is abstract while
at location (1,0) is instable. Thus, re-usability metric measures
how far away a package is from these points.
